# Scalable_MachineLearning

## Deploy SageMaker Project

In this lab through Educative.io, we made a notebook instance, deployed a machine-learning model in the Jupyter Notebook on the instance, and hosted the model on an endpoint with Amazon SageMaker. Moreover, we used a Lambda function to access the endpoint and updated its code to retrieve a response from the hosted model. At the end of the lab, we deployed REST API to trigger the Lambda function with a payload and tested it with a URL.
